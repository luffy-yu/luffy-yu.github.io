about_me_description:
  I, Luffy Yu, 于留传 (yú liú chuán) in Chinese, was born in Heze, Shandong and with a sense of genuineness, warm-heartedness, kind-heartedness, and vigor.
  When I was young, I loved playing TV games (e.g. 小霸王 in Chinese) and computer games (e.g. the Road Rash).
  In other words, I was not hard-working in the study.
  In 2008, when Beijing held the 29th Summer Olympics, I got admitted into the <a class="highlight-link" href="https://baike.baidu.com/item/%E5%B1%B1%E4%B8%9C%E7%9C%81%E8%8F%8F%E6%B3%BD%E7%AC%AC%E4%B8%80%E4%B8%AD%E5%AD%A6" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Heze No.1 Middle School</a>.
  After that, I entered the <a class="highlight-link" href="http://www.sdust.edu.cn/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Shandong University of Science and Technology</a>.
  And then, I luckily matriculated at <a class="highlight-link" href="https://www.bjtu.edu.cn/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Beijing Jiaotong University</a> for a master's degree in software engineering.
  And I felt highly honoured to be supervised by Associate Professor <a class="highlight-link" href="http://faculty.bjtu.edu.cn/7799/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Hua Huang</a>.
  Fortunately, I graduated in this magic year, 2020.
  My hobbies are running, playing badminton, hiking, climbing mountains, listening to English songs, and watching movies (e.g. the Marvel movies).
  Last but not least, I am not immune to fantastic technologies and I have been enjoying coding.
  More often than not, I am a bit geeky. Here is one of my anecdotes, <a class="highlight-link" href="/assets/img/ipad.jpg" target="_self" rel="noreferrer">how to find the owner of a locked iPad?</a>
